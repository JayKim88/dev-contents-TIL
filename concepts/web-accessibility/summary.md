## Overview

"accessible " means that any user can use all its features and content, regardless of how the user accesses the web — even and especially users with physical or mental impairments.

Sites should be accessible to keyboard, mouse, and touch screen users, and any other way users access the web, including screen readers and voice assistants like Alexa and Google Home.
Applications should be understandable and usable by people regardless of auditory, visual, physical, or cognitive abilities.

### 1. what is accessibility ?

Building accessible sites benefit everyone:

- Semantic HTML, which improves accessibility, also improves SEO, making your site more findable.
- Caring about accessibility demonstrates good ethics and morals, which improves your public image.
- Other good practices that improve accessibility also make your site more usable by other groups, such as mobile phone users or those on low network speed. In fact, everyone can benefit from many such improvements.
- Providing accessible sites is part of the law in some countries,

What kinds of disability are we looking at?

- People with visual impairments  
  : Many people with visual impairments use screen magnifiers that are either physical magnifiers or software zoom capabilities. Most browsers and operating systems these days have zoom capabilities. Some users will rely on screen readers, which is software that reads digital text aloud.
- People with hearing impairments  
  : To provide access, textual alternatives must be provided. Videos should be manually captioned, and transcripts should be provided for audio content. Furthermore, due to high levels of language deprivation in DHH populations, text simplification should be considered
- People with mobility impairments
  : Some people might have difficulty making the exact hand movements required to use a mouse, while others might be more severely affected, perhaps being significantly paralyzed to the point where they need to use a head pointer to interact with computers.
- People with cognitive impairments  
   A good foundation of accessibility for people with cognitive impairments includes:
  - Delivering content in more than one way, such as by text-to-speech or by video.
  - Easily understood content, such as text written using plain-language standards.
  - Focusing attention on important content.
  - Minimizing distractions, such as unnecessary content or advertisements.
  - Consistent webpage layout and navigation.
  - Familiar elements, such as underlined links blue when not visited and purple when visited.
  - Dividing processes into logical, essential steps with progress indicators.
  - Website authentication as easy as possible without compromising security.
  - Making forms easy to complete, such as with clear error messages and simple error recovery.

### 2. HTML: A good basis for accessibility

Keep in mind the importance of using semantic HTML (sometimes called POSH, or Plain Old Semantic HTML). This means using the correct HTML elements for their intended purpose as much as possible.

Semantic HTML doesn't take any longer to write than non-semantic (bad) markup if you do it consistently from the start of your project. Even better, semantic markup has other benefits beyond accessibility:

- Easier to develop with — as mentioned above, you get some functionality for free, plus it is arguably easier to understand.
- Better on mobile — semantic HTML is arguably lighter in file size than non-semantic spaghetti code, and easier to make responsive.
- Good for SEO — search engines give more importance to keywords inside headings, links, etc. than keywords included in non-semantic <div>s, etc., so your documents will be more findable by customers.
