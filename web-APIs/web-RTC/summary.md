## WebRTC API

<br/>
WEBRTC is basically web real-time communication through browsers. It allows communication between browsers
A WEBRTC web application is programmed as a mixture of HTML and JavaScript.The user can also use CSS to customize the look of communication. It works and communicates with web browsers through the standardized WebRTC API. 
  
WebRTC consists of several interrelated APIs and protocols which work together to achieve this.

### Interoperability

It should be strongly considered making use of the Adapter.js library provided by Google before you begin to write your code Because each browser has different levels of support for codecs and WebRTC features.

Adapter.js uses shims and polyfills to smooth over the differences among the WebRTC implementations across the environments supporting it. Adapter.js also handles prefixes and other naming differences to make the entire WebRTC development process easier, with more broadly compatible results.

### Usage

- audio and video conferencing
- file exchange
- screen sharing
- identity management
